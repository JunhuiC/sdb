We have recently used the Java Service Wrapper:
http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/
to run the Sequoia Controller as a service under Windows. 

See
http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/integrate-simple-win.html
for basic setup information

You will find the wrapper.conf he uses to configure the Sequoia Controller.
